    <H3>Description</H3>
    <p>Hong Shao Rou (红烧肉) is a sticky, sweet, aromatic and umami braised meat dish that's a classic across China. Similar dishes exist in many
        Asian countries, but the key ingredients for an authentic Chinese version include rock sugar, dark soy sauce, star anise and Xhaoxing wine.

    <H3>Ingredients</H3>
    <ol>
        <li>2 pounds skin-on pork belly</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons rock sugar</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons light soy sauce</li> 
        <li>1/4 cup Shaoxing wine</li>
        <li>1/3 cup dark soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 inch knob ginger</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>4-6 dried Chinese chili peppers</li>
    </ol>
    <H3>Steps</H3>
    <ul>
        <li>Add pork belly to a pot, cover with water and bring to a boil. After 5 minutes, skim any impurities, remove the pork belly and reserve the blanching liquid.</li>
        <li>Wash the pork belly. Cut the pork belly into one inch chunks and set aside.
        <li>Wash the pot before slowly heating the rock sugar on low in oil until it's dissolved and creates a dark brown caramel.</li>
        <li>Brown the pork belly pieces on all sides in the caramel. Depending on the size of the pot, you may need to do this in batches.</li>
        <li>Once all of the meat has been browned, add it all back in. Add in the reserved blanching liquid, along with all of the other ingredients.</li>
        <li>Cover the pot and wait for it to boil. Keep it on a low simmer for 90-120 minutes. The pork is reaady when you can easily pass a chopstick through the meat with little resistance.</li>
        <li>If the braising liquid is not thick enough to coat a spoon, you may remove the meat to further thicken the sauce prior to serving.</li>
    </ul>
