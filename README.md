#Introduction

This is a basic recipe website that I am making as a part of The Odin Project's Foundations course (https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes).

After completeting this website, I will have demonstrated an ability to create a basic website using HTML and an ability to use Github to track my progress.
